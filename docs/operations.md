# Operations

This is the operator-facing runtime guide for the current repo-owned deployment model.

## Daily Runtime Commands

```bash
npm run split
npm run yolo
npm run gateway
npm run agent
npm run operator
npm run agent:docker          # Production profile (network_mode: "none")
npm run agent:docker:continuous # Continuous/dev profile (isolated internal network)
```

- `split` is the standard gateway + agent + operator launcher.
- `split` loads `.env` for gateway/operator processes and launches the agent with a curated non-secret environment allowlist; provider credentials, API keys, and admin tokens must not be agent-owned.
- `yolo` keeps the split runtime but broadens gateway `fs.read` scope across the codebase.
- `operator` runs only the Garden operator surface when you want it separate from the launcher.
- `agent:docker` is the production profile (`network_mode: "none"`).
- `agent:docker:continuous` is the continuous/dev profile on an isolated internal network.
- Use `npm run verify:agent-docker-isolation` after changing compose files or operator docs.

## Production Deployment

The repo already contains the system-account installer:

```bash
scripts/system/install-psfn-service.sh
```

What it does:

- creates or reuses a dedicated service account
- stages a repo-owned checkout under the service home
- bundles a Node binary under the app root
- writes the filtered env file under the deployed checkout at `deployment/systemd/psfn.env`
- renders the authoritative unit under the deployed checkout at `deployment/systemd/psfn.service`
- links `/etc/systemd/system/psfn.service` to that repo-owned rendered unit as the only required external pointer
- can optionally run the persistence cutover before enabling the service

Use `--dry-run` first. Keep authoritative env and runtime wiring in the deployed repo tree; do not create shadow service config elsewhere. The installer-owned unit injects the production layout paths and `PSFN_SKIP_DOTENV=true`, while the filtered env file only carries env-owned values that remain appropriate to source from disk.

## Persistence Cutover

Use this when moving from legacy shared `data/` layout into split roots:

```bash
npm run migrate:persistence-layout
npm run migrate:persistence-layout -- --apply
```

The cutover tooling:

- builds a migration plan
- validates source/target conflicts
- copies or relocates artifacts into system-data and companion-data
- writes a migration manifest under the backup area

Production startup should not proceed until the cutover plan is clean.

## Migration Boundary Until Beta

The live alpha migration boundary is defined in [`docs/specifications.md`](./specifications.md). Operationally, keep migration support explicit and temporary:

- Use `npm run migrate:persistence-layout` for legacy shared-root data. Do not keep the old shared root mounted as a runtime fallback after cutover.
- Use continuous/local `DATA_DIR` only for local development and smoke testing. Production must use split roots and fail closed on shared-root or partial split-root wiring.
- Keep `WORKSPACE_PATH` as the personal files root. It must not overlap runtime data roots; live Purrsephone personal files live under repo-root `purrsephone/`, while active config, databases, sessions, telemetry, and identity artifacts remain under runtime data.
- Treat owner-file drift warnings as cleanup signals, not as permission to keep `.env` as mutable config authority.
- Review config, startup, persistence, and tool-surface changes against the live boundary. If a compatibility path is not named there, reject it, make it fail closed, or track it for beta removal before expanding it.
- When migration-boundary guidance changes, run `npm run verify:settings-contract` and `npm run verify:startup-owner-files` in addition to the affected runtime validation.

## Persistence Backends

PostgreSQL is the required backend for the repo-owned runtime. SQLite-backed stores are retained only for legacy migration utilities, explicit repair flows, and tests that exercise those adapters directly.

Operational rules:

- JSONL L0 remains authoritative even when a database mirror is enabled.
- Fast-search tables and indices are projections that can be rebuilt from canonical archive truth.
- Backend-specific adapter code stays behind the port/composition layer.
- PostgreSQL long-term memory requires the `pgvector` extension. Startup and migrations fail closed when `pgvector` is unavailable; there is no supported fallback to `DOUBLE PRECISION[]` scanning.
- If a backend or projection strategy changes, run `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, and targeted parity tests for the affected domains before treating the change as safe.
- If projection drift is suspected, repair from the archive before trusting search results or operator views.
- Use `npm run session:repair:transcript-projection` to rebuild the searchable transcript projection from authoritative JSONL L0 after drift, backend migration, or recovery work.
- The repair utility accepts `--data-dir` and `--sessions-dir` overrides and targets the configured PostgreSQL session projection backend through the port layer.

## Backups And Integrity

- Backup cadence and retention live in `backup.json` and `scheduler.json`.
- Under the PostgreSQL runtime backend the scheduled backup captures a `pg_dump` custom-format archive (requires `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` on PATH) plus session JSONL, memory journal, and character-card files; the scheduler refuses to start without a database backup source.
- The scheduled backup also captures the full companion-data file tree (journals, generated media/selfies, vault notes, prompt and card history, scratchpad) into `companion-tree/` with a per-file sha256 manifest; the walk is exhaustive except for sessions (captured separately), backup targets, and repair snapshots, so new companion-authored file classes can never silently fall out of scope.
- `WORKSPACE_PATH` is captured separately into `workspace-tree/` with its own sha256 manifest. This covers personal docs, downloads, images, journal/scratchpad files, authored skills/modules, experiments, and the canonical `knowledge/wiki/` store. Runtime roots, backup targets, VCS metadata, dependency directories, caches, and temp directories are excluded and recorded in the manifest.
- Workspace backup fails closed if `WORKSPACE_PATH` overlaps runtime data roots, logs, temp, backup output, the mirror target, or other protected runtime paths. Keep personal wiki/reference documents under `WORKSPACE_PATH/knowledge/wiki/`; do not rely on the external Obsidian bridge for canonical storage or backup coverage.
- With `verifyRestore` enabled, every scheduled cycle restores the dump into a dedicated scratch database (`<dbname>_restore_verify`, derived from the runtime database URL) and asserts schema, pgvector functionality on restored vectors, critical-table presence, and that tables populated at the source restored non-empty. One-time setup: `CREATE DATABASE <dbname>_restore_verify OWNER <runtime-role>` and `CREATE EXTENSION vector` in it as superuser (the extension survives wipes; user tables/sequences/views are dropped each run). The dump archive table of contents is also checked via `pg_restore --list`, companion-tree and workspace-tree manifest hashes are re-verified, and the L0 journal snapshot must parse as JSONL.
- `npm run verify:backup-restore -- --backup-dir <snapshot> --postgres-restore-url <scratch-url> [--postgres-source-url <url>]` runs the same fidelity verification against any backup set (the decant rehearsal).
- A failed scheduled backup logs an error and emits a `backup.failed` event on the runtime event bus.
- Startup skips SQLite integrity checks for the PostgreSQL runtime backend.
- Embedding-dimension mismatches are surfaced at startup.
- Use this verification when backup behavior changes:

```bash
npm run verify:backup-restore
```

## Heartbeat Audit Posture

Use `schedule action=list_templates` when you need the live reflection/scheduler classification, not raw prompt text.

The default reflection set is intentionally consolidated:

- `daily-review`: private multi-turn reflection that can cover mood, goals, memory, and metacognitive continuity when the rest window allows it.
- `weekly-review`: broader consolidation and planning pass for durable themes, values, and longer arcs.
- Heartbeat remains a runtime cadence/checkpoint. It should not burn tokens unless useful work is configured.

Operational rule: silent/background intervals are valid outcomes. Do not treat every cadence tick as requiring a visible note or a durable extraction artifact.

## Re-Embedding

Re-embed when any of these change:

- embedding provider
- embedding model
- embedding dimensions
- vector format expectations

Relevant commands:

```bash
npm run migrate:embeddings
npm run verify:backup-restore
```

Validate retrieval quality after the migration, not just command success.

## TLS And Proxy Trust

For the LiteLLM proxy and custom CAs:

```bash
./scripts/cert-setup.sh --help
```

Key runtime wiring:

- `GATEWAY_TLS_CA_PATH` adds a trusted CA bundle for outbound TLS
- `GATEWAY_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false` disables TLS verification and should stay development-only

If you enable HTTPS on the bundled proxy, update the proxy compose mounts and keep the certs under the repo-owned tree.

## Validation Commands

These are the common operational checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
npm run smoke:chat
npm run e2e
npm run e2e:voice
npm run verify:settings-contract
npm run verify:repository-hygiene
npm run verify:agent-docker-isolation
```

- `npm run smoke:chat` exercises the split-runtime admin bootstrap and chat completion path; set `PSFN_SMOKE_REPORT_PATH=/tmp/psfn-smoke-report.json` to capture a JSON artifact with the bootstrap, chat, and optional voice checks.
- `npm run verify:startup-owner-files` is the canonical startup preflight for the split-runtime owner-file contract; `npm run e2e` assumes that preflight has already passed.
- `npm run e2e` uses the isolated split-runtime harness under `src/app/e2e/e2e-test.ts`, with scripted local LLM responses so it does not consume ambient repo owner files or external model credentials.
- `npm run e2e:voice` exercises the isolated voice round-trip harness on the split runtime.
- Offline eval, validation, and model-experimentation commands live in the sibling `../psfn-eval-toolkit` repository.

For Discord voice specifically:

```bash
npm run smoke:discord:dm-voice -- --dry-run --strict
```

## Failure Triage

Check these first:

- runtime mode and path layout wiring in `.env`
- owner-file validity under `system-data/`
- gateway socket path and process pairing
- PostgreSQL connectivity, migration, and embedding-dimension warnings
- backup and migration manifests under the runtime backup root

If behavior seems inconsistent with old docs, prefer the split-runtime topology: gateway owns the public API edge, operator owns Garden HTTP/UI, and agent owns the companion loop plus private admin transport.
