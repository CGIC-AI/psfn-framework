# Sprint 10 — Next Steps

Status: 2026-07-08. Companion doc to [`sprint-10-multi-companion.md`](./sprint-10-multi-companion.md) (the plan, v2) and [`SPRINT_10_LOCATIONS.md`](./SPRINT_10_LOCATIONS.md) (the locations plan). Those two answer "what are we building and why"; this one answers "what happens next, in what order, before this ships." Bead ids below are enumerated in [`sprint-10-multi-companion-beads.jsonl`](./sprint-10-multi-companion-beads.jsonl) (26 beads, epic `psfn-framework-s10mc` + `psfn-framework-vinz` children + future-idea beads).

The headline fact governing everything below: the multi-companion substrate is **code-complete** on `feat/multi-companion` @ `6608579f` (45 commits ahead of `main`), gated at every merge with build + lint + targeted vitest. It is **not yet validated** — no full runtime has booted the branch, because the implementation sandbox has no `.env` secrets and Docker there cannot publish ports. Code-complete and validated are different claims; §1 keeps them visually distinct, and closing that gap (`psfn-framework-s10f8`) is the first gate in §2.

## 1. Where things stand

| Merge (→ `feat/multi-companion`) | Delivered | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `99ebd9c1` mc/w3-companions-config | `companions.json` owner file + `PSFN_MULTI_COMPANION` flag, fail-closed both directions (W3 phase 1, `s10mc.3`) | code-complete |
| `ee375e39` mc/w2-postgres-schemas | Schema-aware pools (`search_path` via libpq options), `COMPANION_PG_SCHEMA`, per-schema migration runner, `shared` schema chain (W2, `s10mc.2`) | code-complete, validated against a live Postgres in-sandbox |
| `bcca5c20` mc/w1-gateway-multiplexing | Companion-addressed gateway routing: `companionId` on identify/correlation, `Map<companionId, connection>`, fail-closed crossover with audit DENY + ntfy alarms, 23-test crossover suite (2 agents × 10 concurrent colliding-id requests) (W1, `s10mc.1`) | code-complete, unit/integration validated |
| `98e964eb` s10-location-foundations | Places registry (`places.json`), static satellite→place binding, situated-presence runtime context, room-entry system note — the locations-epic threshold multi-companion builds on | code-complete |
| `cf3dc9d1` mc/p2-supervisor-launcher | Multi-companion supervisor mode for the split launcher, spawns one agent process per `companions.json` entry | code-complete |
| `75abf583` mc/p2-per-companion-backups | Per-companion backup slices + `groupMode` cluster/group backups; schema-scoped `pg_dump` (part of W2, `s10mc.2`) | code-complete; `verify:backup-restore` green |
| `eda410a4` mc/p2-discord-per-companion | Per-companion Discord bot accounts (`channels.json` `discord.accounts[]` + `tokenRef`), per-account adapter instances, sibling-bot ingest, structurally-impossible cross-account egress | code-complete |
| `53033de6` mc/w5b-wiki-scopes | `personal` vs `shared_world:<siteId>` wiki scope, retrieval keyed off current site, direct shared-write rejection at the store chokepoint (W5b, part of `s10mc.5`) | code-complete |
| `ac389e5b` mc/w5a-companion-presence | Shared-schema `companion_presence` table (race-safe provisioning via advisory lock), co-presence in situated context, `presence.companion.co_located` event, 15-min TTL for crash ghosts (W5a, part of `s10mc.5`) | code-complete |
| `3df117e0` mc/p2-wiring-gaps | Fleet backup scheduling (leader-elected: first companion in `companions.json`) + presence heartbeat refresh | code-complete |
| `6608579f` mc/w4-gardens-fleet | Per-companion Gardens via the supervisor + gateway-served fleet-status page (`FLEET_STATUS_PORT`, loopback-only, read-only) (W4, `s10mc.4`) | code-complete |

Every row above is gated by build + lint + targeted vitest, not a booted process. Locations work continues past the `98e964eb` merge point on the user's side (`s10-loc-emanation`, `s10-loc-enrollment`/`-v2`, `s10-loc-durable-state`); convergence is pending (§2b). ~76 pre-existing test failures on `main` predate all of this and are independently confirmed (`s10f6`).

## 2. Critical path to "everything together"

In order — later steps assume earlier ones are done, except (b) and (a) can run concurrently once someone has a real machine:

**(a) Full-runtime validation, flag off then flag on** — `psfn-framework-s10f8`, **P1, entry gate for everything else**. On a machine with real credentials: boot flag-off and run `smoke:chat` + `e2e` to prove single-companion inertness in an actual process (ideally through the `psfn-live-ops` validation gate); then boot flag-on with a two-entry `companions.json` against a scratch Postgres, two Discord bots in one channel, and confirm routed delivery plus a fatigue-bounded MI↔MI exchange with zero crossover alarms. This also closes the spike bead `psfn-framework-s10mc.8`. Nothing below should be treated as "done" until this runs — every merge to date is test-gated, not runtime-gated.

**(b) Converge the remaining `s10-loc-*` branches** into `feat/multi-companion`. Locations work advanced past the `98e964eb` merge point independently (`s10-loc-emanation`, `s10-loc-enrollment`(-v2), `s10-loc-durable-state`). These touch the same seams multi-companion already extended (`places.json`, satellite binding, situated context) — merge conflicts are expected at the situated-presence and presence-registry layers, not just textual diff noise. Do this before further W5/W6 work lands, or the two lines of development re-diverge.

**(c) W6 — same-cluster inter-companion channels** (`psfn-framework-s10mc.6`) — the last unbuilt workstream. The building blocks are already in place: `presence.companion.co_located` fires from `companion_presence` (merged @ `ac389e5b`), the `ChannelAdapterPort` abstraction already treats a companion-to-companion channel as "just another channel," and `companion_room`/`quiet_companion_room` fatigue budgets already exist in `charge-policy.seed.json`. What's missing is the wiring: peer-as-contact (`isMachineIntelligence`, operator-assigned trust tier), the IPC one-to-one shape, the ad-hoc many-to-many room shape, and extending `two-companion-loop.test.ts` through the real channel path (not just the engine).

**(d) Flagship cutover off `public` schema + shard schema derivation** (remainder of `psfn-framework-s10mc.2`) — **hard gate: verify a restore round-trip of a real flagship snapshot first.** The cutover helper moves the flagship's live data out of the `public` schema into its own `companion_<uuid>` schema; doing that against production data without first proving restore works is the one step in this plan with irreversible-mistake risk. Restore build-out itself is tracked separately as `psfn-framework-s10d7` (deferred, but needed before (d) touches anything real) — sequence: prove restore on a copy, then cut over.

**(e) Presence-windowed private-room delivery** (remainder of `psfn-framework-s10rm`, locations-side). Entry-event system notes already merged (`144fb5c9` → `98e964eb`); what remains is delivering room chat only between join and exit for private/invite rooms (so L0 naturally holds only what was witnessed, no extraction-pipeline change needed), the group-chat exemption (public/group-marked channels see everything regardless of presence), and the who-related/privacy-level memory-tag tweaks.

**(f) Live two-companion demo** — closes `psfn-framework-s10mc.8` for real (crossover correctness is already proven under test load; this is the "watch it happen" milestone): two agent processes, one gateway, one hand-made shared room channel, a fatigue-bounded MI↔MI conversation observed on real infrastructure. This is naturally the same exercise as (a)'s flag-on half — treat them as one activity, not two.

## 3. Hardening before deploy

Gaps identified in a post-implementation review pass, not yet filed as blocking the critical path above but real before this fleet runs unattended:

- **Per-companion model-usage attribution is missing gateway-side.** The audit trail carries `companionId`; the model-usage/cost store does not. Without it, per-companion cost/usage reporting in the fleet view (`s10f7`) has no data to read.
- **Session Postgres adapters have zero tenancy** if a session store is ever used per-companion rather than per-process-isolated files — worth an explicit audit before anyone relies on it, since the general Postgres tenancy fix (`s10mc.2`) was schema-per-companion at the pool level, not per-table column tenancy, and session stores weren't in the original ~35-table gap list.
- **Scheduler thundering herd.** N companions on one process host means N × heartbeat/sleeptime timers with no jitter; `SleeptimeWikiPass` in particular runs nightly per companion and would fire in lockstep. Needs randomized jitter before a fleet size makes this visible.
- **Sibling-contact trust onboarding defaults.** Fleet siblings (companions on the same cluster) should get operator-assigned trust tiers at provisioning time in `companions.json`/`trust-policy.json`, not fall through to stranger-contact defaults on first sibling ingest.
- **MI attribution test gap for L0/L2 extraction in shared rooms.** Need a test proving sibling assertions in a shared room land in L0/L2 as ordinary speech (attributed to the peer), never silently promoted to facts — this is the same boundary the fold-review quarantine pattern exists for elsewhere in the codebase, but W6 (`s10mc.6`) doesn't yet have a test asserting it for the conversational path itself.
- **Security pass on new surfaces:** admin-socket permissions across N per-companion Gardens, ntfy alarm-flooding rate limits (the crossover-detection alarms are loud by design — good for a single incident, bad if a misconfiguration causes a storm), and the fleet-status listener's threat model (currently loopback-only by design, but the network-mode variant noted in `s10f7` needs its own review when it exists).
- **k8s/docker topology.** The supervisor launcher is a single-host dev shape (N processes, one host). k3s wants one agent container per companion; manifests are untouched by this sprint. Not blocking the current critical path, but blocking real multi-companion deploy.
- Plus the standing follow-up beads: `s10f1` (Discord voice has no per-account lane yet — voice fails closed under multi-companion today), `s10f3` (docs pass — `docs/operations.md`/`docs/setup.md` don't cover any of this yet), `s10f4` (Garden channel editor doesn't round-trip `companionId`/`accounts` fields, so an admin edit could silently drop routing), `s10f6` (the ~76 pre-existing `main` test failures — orthogonal to this sprint but mask real regressions on every branch), `s10f7` (fleet status page has no fatigue/charge posture column — the gateway has no cheap authority for it yet).

## 4. Post-sprint roadmap

In rough value order once the critical path (§2) and hardening (§3) are done:

1. **Deploy a second companion to k3s alongside the flagship** — the first real multi-companion deployment, proving the whole stack outside dev/sandbox conditions.
2. **Build the world** — populate `places.json` with real sites beyond the reference scenario, wire the MUD-over-Discord channels (`SPRINT_10_LOCATIONS.md` Workstream A3), seed the shared wiki with real world content.
3. **Wiki caretaker** (`psfn-framework-s10d5`) — detailed design of the dedup/rebalance/cleanup layer that currently ships as the minimal propose→approve flow; needed before the shared wiki scales past a handful of hand-approved entries.
4. **Per-companion trust/charge/capability-tier owners** — W3 phase 2 (temperament), the remainder of `psfn-framework-s10mc.3`: today only `companions.json` itself and backup `groupMode` are per-companion; trust-policy, charge-policy, capability-tier, and settings are still system-global singletons.
5. **Free-time world-wandering lanes** — companions visiting places and each other during idle/free-time budgets, using the co-location events and run-charge lane quotas already described in W6.
6. **Voice**: land `s10f1` (per-account Discord voice lane) first as the pragmatic unblock, then `s10d6` (the fuller voice subsystem rewrite — the Wyoming-based approach is explicitly flagged as likely non-final).
7. **Restore build-out** (`psfn-framework-s10d7`) — per-companion and group restore mirroring the one-to-one backup model; needed in full before the flagship cutover (§2d) touches production data, and independently useful before any real fleet operates unattended.
8. **Horizon** (all explicitly deferred, tracked as future-idea beads, not scoped into this sprint): cross-cluster ICP trust model (`s10d1`) → cognitive security firewall at the gateway (`s10d2`, blocks full rollout of `s10d1`) → management capability tier above autonomy (`s10d4`). Cross-cluster world-info sync (`s10d3`) sits alongside these, gated on the intra-cluster shared wiki + caretaker being proven first.
